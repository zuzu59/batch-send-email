sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mutt


Configure mutt

To configure it, we need to create ~./muttrc and put inside the file this contents

set from = "user@gmail.com"
set realname = "Guillermo Garron"
set imap_user = "user@gmail.com"
set imap_pass = "password"
set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com:993"
set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
set postponed ="+[Gmail]/Drafts"
set header_cache =~/.mutt/cache/headers
set message_cachedir =~/.mutt/cache/bodies
set certificate_file =~/.mutt/certificates
set smtp_url = "smtp://user@smtp.gmail.com:587/"
set smtp_pass = "password"
set move = no
set imap_keepalive = 900


Create the folders

mkdir -p /.mutt/cache

Change, for your user and your password, and you are done.
Sending emails

Now that mutt is configured it is ready to start sending emails.

mutt -s "Test from mutt" user@yahoo.com < /tmp/message.txt

And if you need to send an attachment

mutt -s "Test from mutt" user@yahoo.com < /tmp/message.txt -a /tmp/file.jpg

-s “Test from mutt” is the subject -a /tmp/file.jpg is the attachment /tmp/message.txt is the message itself

This is another way to write the test, having the body in the same line.

echo "This is the body" | mutt -s "Testing mutt" user@yahoo.com -a /tmp/XDefd.png

If you need to use send emails from a script, just use that line in the script, but be sure that is the user that has the .muttrc file in his / her home directory the one that runs the script.
